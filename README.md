# gallery-markers
add markers for photo locations using the Google Maps js API

see the demo gallery here: http://www.micromediaweb.com/home/nortonb/hypertext/gallery/markers.php
(You will need to use Edge, Internet Explorer since Chrome now requires an https (secure) connection for the HTML5 geolocation API)
Would appreciate if someone could confirm if geolocation works in Safari / Firefox without https.
